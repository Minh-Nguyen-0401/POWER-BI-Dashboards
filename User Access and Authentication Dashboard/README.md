## About Dashboard

This dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of users' login behaviors, allowing for real-time analysis and deeper insights into how users interact with a system. The data was extracted directly from the data lakehouse via an ODBC gateway, with server-side transformations applied through optimized SQL queries to ensure minimal data loading time.

By focusing on key login events and authentication methods, this dashboard delivers valuable insights into user engagement and security patterns. It tracks various authentication methods—including phone, email, and social logins like Google OAuth2—and categorizes verification purposes and statuses to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful login attempts. Additionally, it analyzes device types to understand how users access the system, whether via mobile, desktop, or other platforms.
