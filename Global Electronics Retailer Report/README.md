## Insights/Findings:
### 1. What types of products does the company sell, and where are customers located?
- The company sells all kinds of household products, ranging from electronics (computers, TV, audio, CDs, audio book ...) to more traditional necessities such as washing machine, heater, and air conditioner. Even games and toys are among the listed.

### 2. Are there any seasonal patterns or trends for order volume or revenue?
- Over the years, it is discernible that the revenue peaks often hover around the years' end, specifically December and typically hit a low in April. There was an exception for 2020 of which the October and November witnessed a gradual drop to just over its bottom. Also, this is the year where total sales underwent significant decreases year-through. The reason could most likely be the drastic impact of Covid-19 pandemic peaking around that period, where major shutdowns and quanrantine restrict purchasing power of customers as well as the company's logistics.

### 3. How long is the average delivery time in days? Has that changed over time?
- The all-time average delivery time is 4.8 days. The number used to be 6.3 in 2016; howver, it happened to be changing for the better, heading towards new milestones of around 4.5 days.
- Noticeable soars in the average delivery time were recorded in August 2020 and January 2021, in turns, reaching two unprecedented peaks of over 8 and 7.5 days


### 4. Is there a difference in average order value (AOV) for online vs. in-store sales?
- In 2021, the average order value for both platforms (online and in-store) is slightly over $2,000, despite the first position in ranking almost always being taken by the brick-and-mortar business approach. This ushers in a potential prospect for online business strategy of the business

## Business Strategy Recommendation:
- In the upcoming quarter, the business should implement a new strategy focusing on the online platform to leverage its growing potential. Specifically, targeting customers aged 60 and above, who currently contribute 45% of total sales, particularly those from the US and Canada (Ontario). This entails modifying the current UI of the online platform to make product content more concise and organized in a synchronized and key-info centered manner. 
- Additionally, another strategy to optimize this customer segment could be implementing personalized recommendations based on their purchase history and preferences. Since most revenues from this segment come from electronics, specifically computers, TVs/CDs, and traditional home appliances like water heaters and washers, related products and content should be prominently featured. Utilizing a familiar communication approach, such as sending newsletters with enticing promotional offers or daily news/articles related to these products, can further engage this demographic and drive sales.
